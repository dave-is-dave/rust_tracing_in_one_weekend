# Rust Tracing: The Rest of Your Life

_Note: This one is pretty unfinished compared to the other two. IRRC the code added here covers only about half of the chapters (not in order) in 'The Rest of Your Life'..._

A sketchy rust implementation of the the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series by Peter Shirley which can be found at [raytracing.github.io](https://raytracing.github.io/).

The source for each of his three books can be found on each branch in this repo:

- ray_tracing_in_one_weekend
- ray_tracing_the_next_week
- ray_tracing_the_rest_of_your_life
